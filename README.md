# orson-brusini-v2

This is the 2nd version of orson-brusini that I did right after the first one. It is not responsive.

Changes in this version:

--> The overall width is bigger.

--> The writings on Banner Image are texts, not integrated with image.

--> Banner has a 90deg rotated button which was a challenge for me that time.
